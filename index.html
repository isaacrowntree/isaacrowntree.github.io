                      ...Although Isaac's job title was Senior Developer, in his time
                      with the company Isaac performed many roles outside of that role.
                      He was instrumental in all facets of Digital Development and
                      Digital Marketing. <br><br>

                      Isaac performed as lead architect on many projects; migration to AWS,
                      lead generation (Salesforce), Intranet builds plus numerous more. Isaac also was
                      the lead in all SEO implementations including being an Analytics Analyst. <br><br>

                      Isaac always performed all tasks with a passion and commitment to making a difference,
                      displaying values that not only enhanced the development team,
                      but the greater company as well. <br><br>

                      I have no hesitation in recommending Isaac for any IT/development position
                      and if the chance arises I would happily re-employ him as I truly
                      consider him to be a valuable asset to any team... <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>
